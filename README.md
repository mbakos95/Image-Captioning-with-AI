# Image Captioning with AI

## Overview
This project generates captions for images using a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) and GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It integrates computer vision and natural language processing to describe images with meaningful captions.

## Steps
1. Install required libraries.
2. Load the pre-trained model, tokenizer, and feature extractor.
3. Preprocess the input image.
4. Generate a caption for the image.
5. Display the image with the generated caption.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `transformers`
  - `pillow`
  - `matplotlib`

## Installation
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch transformers pillow matplotlib
